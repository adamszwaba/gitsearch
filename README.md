# The task

It was simple! I really liked the amount of work someone put into the clean, clean design. Was fun to work with.

## The tests

In `App.test.tsx` you will find the kind of tests I would normally do for an app like this. For some reason (and it's almost 9 PM here when I'm doing this, since I hadn't time before), Jest throws a

```
Jest encountered an unexpected token

    This usually means that you are trying to import a file which Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.

    By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring "node_modules".
```

error.

And I know what it means: usually some fancy error somewhere down the line, and seeing that there is a thread related to this particular thing (namely an issue with `transformToNestObject` method in `react-hook-form`), I really don't want to go down this rabbit hole now. Please don't make me.

## Chakra

I don't know if I like it. But it's easy to prototype in, in fact extremely easy, and so I will probably use it a little bit more personally.

It's also very pleasant visually, so that's fun.
